    "## Why Julia?\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is a great language for scientific computing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's fast.\n",
    "2. It's **very fast**.\n",
    "3. You don't need C/C++, Fortran, or other \"slow-productivity\"/\"slow-prototyping\" language.\n",
    "   - Also known as the *two-language problem*.\n",
    "4. It has a friendly syntax.\n",
    "5. Very easy to install (you don't need a C++ toolchain like others programming languages).\n",
    "6. Support for Unicode and $\\LaTeX$ characters.\n",
    "   - No more `alpha` and `beta`; hello to `α` and `β`.\n",
    "7. Easy to add and prototype new algorithms that are fast straight from the gun.\n",
    "8. Great project management and reproducible environments baked into the standard library."
