abstract = {We present here an empirical study comparing the accuracy rates of novices writing
software in three programming languages: Quorum, Perl, and Randomo. The first language,
Quorum, we call an evidence-based programming language, where the syntax, semantics,
and API designs change in correspondence to the latest academic research and literature
on programming language usability. Second, while Perl is well known, we call Randomo
a Placebo-language, where some of the syntax was chosen with a random number generator
and the ASCII table. We compared novices that were programming for the first time
using each of these languages, testing how accurately they could write simple programs
using common program constructs (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions, variables,
parameters). Results showed that while Quorum users were afforded significantly greater
accuracy compared to those using Perl and Randomo, Perl users were unable to write
programs more accurately than those using a language designed by chance.},

year = {2012},
publisher = {USENIX Association},

abstract = {Data-intensive analytics on large clusters is important for modern Internet services.
As machines in these clusters have large memories, in-memory caching of inputs is
an effective way to speed up these analytics jobs. The key challenge, however, is
that these jobs run multiple tasks in parallel and a job is sped up only when inputs
of all such parallel tasks are cached. Indeed, a single task whose input is not cached
can slow down the entire job. To meet this "all-or-nothing" property, we have built
PACMan, a caching service that coordinates access to the distributed caches. This
coordination is essential to improve job completion times and cluster efficiency.
To this end, we have implemented two cache replacement policies on top of PACMan's
coordinated infrastructure fb-LIFE that minimizes average completion time by evicting
large incomplete inputs, and LFU-F that maximizes cluster efficiency by evicting less
frequently accessed inputs. Evaluations on production workloads from Facebook and
Microsoft Bing show that PACMan reduces average completion time of jobs by 53% and
51% (small interactive jobs improve by 77%), and improves efficiency of the cluster
by 47% and 54%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Object-oriented programming is a practical and useful programming methodology that encourages modular design and software reuse. Most object-oriented programming languages support data abstraction by preventing an object from being manipulated except via its defined external operations. In most languages, however, the introduction of inheritance severely compromises the benefits of this encapsulation. Furthermore, the use of inheritance itself is globally visible in most languages, so that changes to the inheritance hierarchy cannot be made safely. This paper examines the relationship between inheritance and encapsulation and develops requirements for full support of encapsulation with inheritance.},

The RPython language allows tracing JIT VMs to be automatically created from an interpreter, changing the economics of VM implementation. In this paper, we explain, through two concrete VMs, how meta-tracing RPython VMs can be designed and optimised, and, experimentally, the performance levels one might reasonably expect from them.}

abstract = {Multiple dispatch uses the run time types of more than one argument to a method call to determine which method body to run. While several languages over the last 20 years have provided multiple dispatch, most object-oriented languages still support only single dispatch forcing programmers to implement multiple dispatch manually when required. This paper presents an empirical study of the use of multiple dispatch in practice, considering six languages that support multiple dispatch, and also investigating the potential for multiple dispatch in Java programs. We hope that this study will help programmers understand the uses and abuses of multiple dispatch; virtual machine implementors optimise multiple dispatch; and language designers to evaluate the choice of providing multiple dispatch in new programming languages.},

	abstract={Total RNA sequencing has been used to reveal poly(A) and non-poly(A) RNA expression, RNA processing and enhancer activity. To date, no method for full-length total RNA sequencing of single cells has been developed despite the potential of this technology for single-cell biology. Here we describe random displacement amplification sequencing (RamDA-seq), the first full-length total RNA-sequencing method for single cells. Compared with other methods, RamDA-seq shows high sensitivity to non-poly(A) RNA and near-complete full-length transcript coverage. Using RamDA-seq with differentiation time course samples of mouse embryonic stem cells, we reveal hundreds of dynamically regulated non-poly(A) transcripts, including histone transcripts and long noncoding RNA Neat1. Moreover, RamDA-seq profiles recursive splicing in >300-kb introns. RamDA-seq also detects enhancer RNAs and their cell type-specific activity in single cells. Taken together, we demonstrate that RamDA-seq could help investigate the dynamics of gene expression, RNA-processing events and transcriptional regulation in single cells.},
