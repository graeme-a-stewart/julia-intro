    "- Julia has full support for *notebook* computing, just like Python\n",
    "- Julia has a well developed package ecosystem, with many tools for common tasks available\n",
    "- Julia has a very robust and modern package manager, making installation a breeze and reproducible environments come basically for free\n",
    "    - No need for cumbersome toolchains\n",
    "- Because of all of these features, Julia is also just a *fun* language to use üòÅ"
