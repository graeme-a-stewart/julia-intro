# Julia Introduction

This is a short Julia tutorial that introduces some of the language fundamentals. It is designed for people who have some familiarity with another programming language, but no specific Julia knowledge.

This tutorial is written as a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), which produces a lovely set of webpages for the material.

In addition, many of the notebooks are annotated with [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) extensions which means that they can be presented as a set of slides using `Reveal.js`. *Caveat emptor*, the only downside here is that MyST markdown can't be used in the RISE notebook content.

## Installation

There is a conda/mamba setup file in `environment.yml`. One also needs to have an up-to-date installation of Julia.
